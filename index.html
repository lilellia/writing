        <h2><i>Elena</i></h2>

        <p class="description">
            Elena Vardis has always been fascinated by the legends of the ancient Thessian magesâ€”the therii. She has
            long dreamed of leaving her safe but boring life in Incerin's capital and adventuring across the sea to find
            the land that, according to legend, puts her homeland to shame. But Elena grew out of her childhood
            obsession, so it's a great surprise when those same legends force themselves back into her life. Her simple
            existence is thrown into chaos as she finds herself in a delicate position among her family, friends, and
            even the Monarchs of the State. The center of a prophecy that stands to change the world, Elena has to act
            now and figure out how far she's willing to go to accomplish her dreams.
