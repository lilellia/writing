    <!-- ELENA -->
    <div class="group">
        <h2><i>Elena</i></h2>

        <p class="description">
            Elena Vardis has always been fascinated by the legends of the ancient Thessian magesâ€”the therii. She has
            long dreamed of leaving her safe but boring life in Incerin's capital and adventuring across the sea to find
            the land that, according to legend, puts her homeland to shame. But Elena grew out of her childhood
            obsession, so it's a great surprise when those same legends force themselves back into her life. Her simple
            existence is thrown into chaos as she finds herself in a delicate position among her family, friends, and
            even the Monarchs of the State. The center of a prophecy that stands to change the world, Elena has to act
            now and figure out how far she's willing to go to accomplish her dreams.

    <!-- Sapphire -->

        <h2><i>Sapphire</i></h2>

        <p class="description">
            Brooklyn was never the type of girl to obsess over romance. In fact, ever since she was little, it's
            something she's only thought <i>about</i>. So, she was caught more than a little off-guard when her high
            school's most popular boy asked her out. As they move away for college to start a new life, it's about time
            to figure out this relationship. With help from friends she makes along the way, Brooklyn eventually finds
            out more about the hidden girl deep inside her she didn't know existed and what she actually wants out of a
            romance, much to her surprise.
        </p>

            <i>Sapphire</i> is an LGTBQ+ "romance" novel that... really isn't. It's designed to be centered around a
            romance and exploration thereof, but it's so much more an exploration of personal discovery and growth, or
            friendships, of acceptance. All in all, <i>Sapphire</i> is, to me, a means of communicating parts of my
            story and others' and providing a lens into those while also allowing me to have the catharsis of exporting
            my own struggles to her in hopes of having a different world to process them in.

        <p class="description">
            A standalone Puella Magi Madoka Magica fanfiction. A conversation between Kaname Madoka and Akemi Homura
            that takes place as an alternative to <a

            This story was inspired by a post I'd seen on <a

            <b>Madoka:</b> "Do you have any skeletons in your closet?" <br />
            <b>Homura:</b> "You mean literally or figuratively?" <br />
            <b>Madoka:</b> "Honestly, the fact that I have to specify..."
