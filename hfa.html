				I close my eyes. <br />

			<p class="poem">
				I shake in excitement, or is it fear? <br />
				I sat, huddled, pressed as tightly in the corner as my body wouldn't allow. <br />
				The only light was the thinnest sliver of the faintness of Diana's globe <br />
				Under the door.
			</p>
	
			<p class="poem">
				I opened the door, still demanding to win that vital game of hide-and-seek. <br />
				She sat on the floor. <br />
				He was there no longer. <br />
				He must have hidden. <br />
				I tried to seek.
			</p>
	
			<p class="poem">
				The dim light of her globe gave me the blessing I required. <br />
				My keepsake, beautifully crafted, left carelessly on the floor. <br />
				I picked it up. It felt molded to my hand, <br />
				Its ordained purpose now fixed to this situation.

				For them, I suffer. <br />
				Then. <br />
				Now. <br />
				Forever. <br />
				It's my fortune. <br />
				I close my eyes. <br />
				I see him still.

				Sitting in class, the seconds tick by— <br />

				This experience is quite novel, <br />

				yet the bird seems not to care.
			</p>
			<p class="poem">
				The birdling stays within its nest. <br />
				There, watching from below, <br />
				loudly she claims, her friends unblamed: <br />
				It hurts not to be slow.
			</p>
			<p class="poem">
				The other birds, alighting down, <br />
				speak oft of their long flights. <br />
				Our little birdling listens long, <br />
				listens throughout the night.
			</p>
			<p class="poem">
				She knows full well that she'd the same, <br />
				their roles, by magic, made reversed. <br />
				Were she the one to chase her dreams, <br />
				her voice would squeal in verse.
			</p>
			<p class="poem">
				Each bird foes fly with its own wings <br />
				and fly on its own pace. <br />
				For some, alas, a pace minute: <br />
				It's a truth which she must face.
			</p>
			<p class="poem">
				And so she dreams, her dreams held high, <br />
				but anxious yet is she. <br />
				Each story told, she asks herself, <br />
				"What if that's not for me?"
			</p>
			<p class="poem">
				Their stories echo through the trees, <br />
				and though she feigns like joy, <br />
				their stories echo 'gainst her skull, <br />
				her brain those sounds' mere toy.
			</p>
			<p class="poem">
				Ironic, then, amidst their crowd, <br/>
				she's left to feel alone. <br/>
				She dreams and dreams to match their acts, <br/>
				her world as cold as stone.
